### Alexa Devices

[Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player) media_player entities require MP3 files be publicly accessible from outside your local network.
If you do not hear playback from Chime TTS on these media players, you may need to ensure that:

1. Your Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml` file includes your `external_url`.
    For example:

    ```configuration.yaml```:
    ```
    homeassistant:
      external_url: "https://YOUR_NABU_CASA_ADDRESS.ui.nabu.casa/"
      internal_url: "http://192.168.X.X:8123/"
    ```

1. You have enabled the public facing [`/www` directory](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#hosting-files).

1. Your [`chime_tts.say_url` folder](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/configuration#chime_ttssay_url-folder) exists inside of your [`/www` directory](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#hosting-files).
