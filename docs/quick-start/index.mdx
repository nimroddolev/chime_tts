Here's how to get started with Chime TTS audio notifications in three simple steps:

1. [Installation](./installing-chime-tts): Install Chime TTS on your Home Assistant device.

2. [Adding the Integration](./adding-the-integration): Easily integrate Chime TTS into your Home Assistant configuration.

3. [Additional Requirements](./additional-requirements): Additional requirements, depending on your setup.

:::warning[TTS Platforms]

Chime TTS _utilises_ TTS platforms, and is NOT a **[TTS integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech)**.

You must have **at least 1 TTS platform configured** in order for Chime TTS to generate TTS audio.
