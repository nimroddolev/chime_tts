# Sending Notifications

See the below example for how to send Chime TTS notifications:

### Basic example
```
  action: notify.reminder
  data:
    message: "Don't forget to pick up the kids!"
```

### Example with parameter overrides
In the below example, the [`chime_path`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say-action/parameters#chime_path) and [`volume_level`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say-action/parameters#volume_level) values defined in the `reminder` notify entry are overridden with custom values:
```
  action: notify.reminder
  data:
    message: "Don't forget to pick up the kids!"
    data:
      chime_path: /media/sounds/chimes/urgent.mp3
      volume_level: 1.0
```
