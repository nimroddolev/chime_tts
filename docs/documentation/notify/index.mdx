# Chime TTS Notify Entries

You can add Chime TTS notify entries to your `configuration.yaml` file, each with specific parameter values.

This allows you to create fully customized & reusable notify entries that can be tailored based on the time of day, who is home, or any other use case you can think of.

## Example Notify Entries

- An "evening" notify entry limited to play on specific media_players with a softer chime and low volume.

- An "announcement" notify entry for home-wide announcements at full volume with a loud chime.

- A "calendar" notify entry used for reminders for upcoming events, that repeats after 5 minutes.

## Why Notify Entries?

**Convenience**: Configure any/all [`chime_tts.say`](../actions/say-action) [parameter](../actions/say-action/parameters) values (chime paths, media players, TTS platform, language, voice, etc) once for all your use-cases, and reuse.

**Flexibility**: Retain the ability to override the defined notify settings across your scripts & automations when needed.

**Efficiency**: Replace long complicated [`chime_tts.say`](../actions/say-action) action calls with simple, clean and predefined notify action calls.
