## What is Chime TTS?

Chime TTS is a custom Home Assistant integration that locally combines TTS audio and sound effects into seamless audio for playback in a single action call, eliminating the lag. Chime TTS includes a [suite of options](#features) to further customize the audio.

### The Problem:

    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/getting-started/the_problem.png')} />
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/animations/travolta.gif')} class='travolta' />
</div>

Adding a notification chime before Text-To-Speech (TTS) audio messages requires two separate action calls, which introduces lag due to networking latency of cloud TTS platforms, audio processing, and delays before media_player playback begins.

### The Solution:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/getting-started/the_solution.png')} />

**Chime TTS** addresses this issue by combining the audio files into _a single file_ locally on your Home Assistant device. This combined file is then played through your speakers in one seamless event, eliminating any lag.

***

##  Features

Chime TTS offers various features that enhance TTS audio playback experience:

- **No lag or timing issues:** Precise timing between audio files without cloud TTS delays.
- **Customizable audio cues:** Play preset or custom audio before, after or in between TTS messages.
- **Flexible TTS platform selection:** Supports various [TTS platform integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech).
- **Easy action invocation:** Use the [`chime_tts.say`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say-action) and [`chime_tts.say_url`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say_url-action) actions in automations and scripts.
- **Set media player volume:** Notifications can be played at a defined volume and restored after playback.
- **Restore previous audio:** Chime TTS supports pausing and resuming currently playing audio beyond the media player platforms supported by Home Assistant *(eg: HomePods)*.
- **Mix and match TTS platforms:** Combine TTS audio using multiple TTS platforms within the same audio announcement.
- **Configurable TTS speed:** Set the TTS audio speed anywhere from 1-500%.
- **Configurable TTS pitch:** Set the pitch for TTS audio, allowing for more customization.
- **Support for FFmpeg arguments:** Apply FFmpeg jobs to the generated audio, or specific jobs to specific chimes and TTS audio segments.
- **Configurable delay:** Set custom delays between chimes & TTS audio.
- **Configurable overlay:** Set custom overlay durations between chimes & TTS audio.

## How Do I Use It?

### Actions

Chime TTS adds 4 actions to your Home Assistant instance: `chime_tts.say`, `chime_tts.say_url`, `chime_tts.replay` and `chime_tts.clear_cache`:

- [`chime_tts.say`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say-action): Play audio and TTS messages with various settings.
- [`chime_tts.say_url`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/say_url-action): Generates a publicly accessible URL to the MP3 file generated by `chime_tts.say`.
- [`chime_tts.replay`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/replay-action): Replays the last action call to `chime_tts.say`.
- [`chime_tts.clear_cache`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/actions/clear_cache-action): Clear generated audio cache.

### Notify Entities

Chime TTS adds a [notify platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify/): "[`chime_tts`](/chime_tts/docs/documentation/notify)", which allows you to create fully customised notify entries for use in your automations and scripts.
