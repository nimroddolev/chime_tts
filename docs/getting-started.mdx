## What is Chime TTS?

Chime TTS is a custom Home Assistant integration that locally combines TTS audio and sound effects into seamless audio for playback in a single service call, eliminating the lag. Chime TTS includes a [suite of options](#features) to further customize the audio.

### The Problem:

    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/getting-started/the_problem.png')} />
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/animations/travolta.gif')} class='travolta' />
</div>

Adding a notification chime before Text-To-Speech (TTS) audio messages requires two separate service calls, and introduces lag between the two caused by networking latency of cloud TTS platforms, audio processing, and delays before media_player playback begins.

### The Solution:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/getting-started/the_solution.png')} />


**Chime TTS** solves this issue by stitching the audio files together as _a single file_ locally on your Home Assistant device, and played to your speakers in a single event, eliminating any lag.

***

##  Features

Chime TTS offers various features that enhance TTS audio playback experience:

- **No lag or timing issues:** Precise timing between audio files without cloud TTS delays.
- **Customizable audio cues:** Play preset or custom audio before and after TTS messages.
- **Flexible TTS platform selection:** Supports various [TTS platform integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech).

-  **Set media player  volume:** Notifications can be played at a defined volume and restored after playback.
- **Restore previous audio:** Chime TTS supports pausing and resuming currently playing audio beyond the media player platforms supported by Home Assistant *(eg: HomePods)*.
